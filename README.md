### Key Changes:
- The **Pulling the Docker Image** section now includes the proper `docker pull spark` command.
- Code snippets have been enclosed within code blocks using triple backticks (` ```bash `) for clear differentiation between code and text.

You can paste this directly into your README file. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
